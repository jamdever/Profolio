        <p>
            During my time at <strong>ATU Sligo</strong>, I studied a General Computing course that gave me a strong foundation
            in programming, database management, and web development. I worked on practical projects that helped me understand
            real-world applications of software development and prepared me for professional challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned how to design and implement software solutions, work collaboratively on team projects, and use modern
            tools and frameworks efficiently. The course also helped me develop problem-solving skills and adapt to new technologies quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            This experience at ATU Sligo gave me the confidence and skills to pursue a career in software development
            and sparked my enthusiasm to continue learning and growing in the tech industry.
